        "list_of_dicts: This is the list of dictionaries that sorted() will operate on.\n",
        "key=lambda x: x[key_to_sort_by]: This is the crucial part that tells sorted() how to determine the sorting order.\n",
        "key is an argument to sorted() that specifies a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons.\n",
        "lambda x: x[key_to_sort_by] is a small anonymous function (a lambda function).\n",
